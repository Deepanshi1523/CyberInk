3. Architecture:

Frontend (React.js):

React is used for building the user interface.
Components for displaying blog posts, handling user authentication, and managing user interactions.
Backend (Node.js with Express.js):

Express.js is used to create a RESTful API.
Routes for user authentication (registration, login) and managing blog posts (CRUD operations).
Interaction with the MongoDB database using Mongoose for data storage and retrieval.
Database (MongoDB):

MongoDB is used as a NoSQL database to store user information, blog posts, and comments.
Authentication (JWT):

JWT is employed for secure user authentication.
When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing the user's information and sends it back to the client.
The client includes this token in the headers of subsequent requests, allowing the server to verify the user's identity.

4. Workflow:

User Registration and Login:

Users register by providing necessary information (username, email, password).
Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
JWT is generated upon successful login and sent to the client.
Blog Post Management:

Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their blog posts.
Blog posts are stored in the MongoDB database.
Authentication with JWT:

JWT is used for secure authentication.
Each request to the server includes the JWT token in the headers.
The server validates the token, allowing or denying access accordingly.
Commenting System:

Users can comment on blog posts.
Comments are associated with specific blog posts in the database.

5. Security Considerations:

Passwords are hashed before storage.
JWT helps secure communication between the client and server.
Authorization checks ensure that users can only edit or delete their own blog posts.
